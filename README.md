# Engine Emissions & Health Dashboard (Sample Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes the connection between emitted gases (CO2, NOx, SO2) and engine health metrics. 
A sample dataset is generated with synthetic values to demonstrate analysis and dashboard creation.

## Dataset
- `engine_emissions_data.xlsx` contains simulated engine data:
  - CO2, NOx, SO2 emissions
  - Operating hours
  - Maintenance health score

## Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap of emissions vs health
- Scatter plot of CO2 vs Maintenance Score
- Emission trends over operating hours

## How to Use
You can load the dataset in **Excel, Power BI, or Tableau** to build dashboards and perform deeper analysis.
